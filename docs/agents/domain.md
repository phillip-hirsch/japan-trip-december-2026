# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout

This repo uses a single-context domain-doc layout:

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root for domain language and glossary entries.
- `docs/adr/` for architectural decision records.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root.
- **`docs/adr/`** - read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept, use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, note it as a possible gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
